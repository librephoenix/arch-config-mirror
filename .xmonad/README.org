* What is XMonad?
XMonad is a tiling window manager written in the Haskell programming language.  I like using it because it is efficient and quick, even though it requires a lot of upfront work to setup and configure to your liking.
* How to Install
Most Linux distributions ship with xmonad in their repositories, but I have found that it is actually most stable to [[./install.org][install XMonad using Stack]], which is a kind of package manager for Haskell.
* My XMonad Config
My entire XMonad (and XMobar) config is in my [[./xmonad.org][xmonad.org]] literate config file.  This config file also contains many supplementary scripts which keep my setup running.
